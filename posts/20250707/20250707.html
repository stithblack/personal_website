        <div class="info">
            <div class="post">
                <p>I decided to do some housekeeping to make my life a little easier. Realistically, we're probably only talking five minutes at a time, but those times do add up and time is all we really have, after all.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Trying to see how many times I could say "time" got old very quick.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Automation is a low-key passion of mine, and I genuinely enjoy trying to make things as efficient as possible. When I first set up this static site, I knew I wanted to be able to automatically update the AWS S3 bucket whenever I pushed a commit in GitHub, and I found out I could use the platform's own CI/CD platform called Actions to achieve that.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Two prerequisites I needed before setting up the workflow was configuring an AWS IAM user and a policy to grant the GitHub Action permission to access the S3 bucket. The policy limited access to the S3 bucket storing the website code. The user was created with an access key, which I added as a Secret within my website repository on GitHub.</p>
                <br>
                <p>After that, I created a directory in my local repositiory for workflow's YAML file and uses <a href="https://dev.to/staubracing/setting-up-github-actions-for-aws-s3-integration-2hg7">this post on DEV</a> as a reference point. One commit later and the updates (including this post) were pushed to the repository and subsequently updated the files in the S3 bucket.</p>
